DESCRIPTION 

This is a set of python modules for reading in and visualizing NYC yellow cab data. 

The source code is in nyc_taxi_viz/src/ and includes:

taxi_main.py        the main module, contains all functions for reading and writing data. 
taxi_plotmod.py     a module with functions for processing raw data and plotting the results
pl_proc_raw.py      a script that processes the raw data to create a spatially binned data product
pl_load_and_map.py  a script that loads a processed file then plots the spatially binned data

DATA

The data is not included here, data source:

NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission - Trip Record Data
http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml


QUICK START STEPS

1. Download data (http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml). These files are about 2 GB EACH. Just one is enough to get started... 

2. (optional) pre-process the .csv file. It's a bit easier to start experimenting if you break up the giant file into more managable chunks. I did this in terminal using the bash command split:

       $ split -l 5000 filename
     
   this while split filename into separate files, each with 5000 lines. 

   Now, move some smaller number of these files into a different directory, say nyc_taxi_viz/data_sub_sampled/

3. If you followed step 2, you can run taxi_main.py and it'll process and map the sub sampled data. 

   If you did not follow step 2, open up taxi_main.py and set the string variable  dir_base equal to the path to the csv file that you downloaded, then run taxi_main.py

   To run, open a terminal and enter

   python taxi_main.py

See pl_proc_raw.py and pl_load_and_map.py for more complicated examples of using the modules.
