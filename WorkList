To do: 

add back a bin-while reading option: three full csv files uses 30-50% memory!

delete bad .py files after plotting works. 

write driver scripts calling the main module to plot different things. 

IMPORTANT: change map_proc so that multiple variables can be binned seimultaneously! Don't want to re-run the binning function every time. Will slow way down.
